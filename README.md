# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Overview
The Interactive Fridge is a fun and practical web application that combines tools for daily productivity, like a to-do list and a weekly calendar, with creative features like photo management. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this project serves as a demonstration of my full-stack development skills.

Key Features
1.To-Do List:
`Add, update, and delete tasks.
`Organize tasks with priority levels (low, medium, high).
`Tasks are stored in the backend for persistence.

2.Weekly Calendar:
`Plan your week by adding events to specific days.
 `View, update, and delete events as needed.
`Events are grouped by day for easy management.
